# 🌐 Flask Projects (Backend & APIs)

This folder contains **Flask-based backend projects** built as part of my applied Python learning journey. These projects focus on **practical backend development**, **API design**, and **real-world use cases**, rather than frontend-heavy applications.

Flask is used here as a **lightweight, flexible backend framework** to understand how real systems expose functionality via HTTP APIs.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of This Folder

The goal of these Flask projects is to:

* Learn **backend fundamentals** (routing, requests, responses)
* Build **REST-style APIs**
* Integrate Python logic with web interfaces
* Prepare a foundation for **FastAPI, Django, and ML-serving APIs**

These projects emphasize **clarity, modularity, and correctness** over complexity.

---

## 🧠 Why Flask?

Flask is chosen because it:

* Is minimal and easy to reason about
* Does not hide backend logic behind heavy abstractions
* Helps understand core concepts like:

  * Request–response cycle
  * URL routing
  * Templates vs APIs
  * Middleware & extensions

This makes Flask ideal for **learning-oriented and utility backend projects**.

## 📁 Folder Structure (Typical)

```text
Flask-Projects/
│
├── project-name/
│   ├── app.py
│   ├── templates/
│   ├── static/
│   ├── requirements.txt
│   └── README.md
│
└── README.md   ← You are here
```

Each project:

* Is self-contained
* Can be run independently
* Has its own README explaining the specific use case

---

## 🧩 Types of Projects Included

Projects in this folder may include:

* Utility APIs (QR generator, PDF tools, TTS, etc.)
* CRUD-based mini backends
* Data-processing APIs
* Prototypes for larger systems

These are **supporting backend projects**, not research-heavy systems.

---

## ⚙️ Common Technologies Used

* **Python**
* **Flask**
* Jinja2 (templates, where applicable)
* SQLAlchemy / SQLite (if database is used)
* Third-party Python libraries (project-specific)

---

## 🚀 How to Run a Flask Project (General)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

Then open:

```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```

---

## 🧠 Learning Focus

These projects help develop:

* Backend logic building
* Clean API structure
* Debugging skills
* Understanding of how Python powers web services

They also act as a **stepping stone toward FastAPI-based ML services** and full-stack systems.

---

## 📌 Notes

* Flask projects here are intentionally kept **simple and focused**
* Larger ML or research systems are maintained in **separate dedicated repositories**
* This folder supports my overall goal of building **end-to-end systems**
